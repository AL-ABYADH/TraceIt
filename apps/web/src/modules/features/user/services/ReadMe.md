## `user/services/` Directory

This folder contains service functions related to the user feature. Services are responsible for handling data fetching, API calls, and business logic that is not directly tied to UI components.

### Guidelines
- Place only user-related service functions here (e.g., API calls, data transformations, business logic).
- Keep services pure and reusableâ€”avoid direct dependencies on React or UI state.
- Export functions for use in hooks, components, or other modules.
